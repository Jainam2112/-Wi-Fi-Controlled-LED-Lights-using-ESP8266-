🚀 Project Launch: Wi-Fi Controlled LED Lights using ESP8266 💡🌐

Excited to share one of my recent IoT projects — LED Light Control via Wi-Fi using ESP8266!

Using the NodeMCU (ESP8266) microcontroller, I built a smart LED system that can be controlled remotely over Wi-Fi. Whether it’s switching lights on/off or laying the groundwork for a smart home system, this project shows how simple hardware + code can create impactful automation.

🛠 Tech Stack:

ESP8266 NodeMCU

Arduino IDE

Wi-Fi Network

LED Circuit

🎯 Key Features:

Real-time LED ON/OFF control

Web-based/mobile-triggered commands

Simple and scalable for home automation

Built using C++ in Arduino IDE

This is a small step toward IoT-driven automation, and there’s so much more to explore. Let’s build smarter together! 💡✨
